# Scarecrow

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/scarecrow/badge/?version=latest)](https://scarecrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pseastham/scarecrow.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/pseastham/scarecrow)

Scarecrow is a python package for the analysis of electrophysiological data. 

## Installation

Install scarecrow from github using the following command:

`pip install git+https://github.com/pseastham/scarecrow.git#egg=scarecrow`

Or with this if you do not have git installed on your machine:

`pip install --upgrade https://github.com/pseastham/scarecrow/tarball/master`

Note that this must be installed in the above manner, and not using the PyPI database. The "scarecrow" on PyPI is unaffiliated and by all accounts inactive.
