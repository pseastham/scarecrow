Welcome to Scarecrow's documentation!
=====================================

This is the documentation for Scarecrow, software for extracting features from electrophysiological traces. This documentation is split into several components, as can be seen on the side bar. In general, there is a user guide that details how to use Scarecrow and explanations for how various features are computed. There is also a developer guide for details on how to contribute, as well as an API for those interested in using Scarecrow's functionality imported into their own python scripts.
